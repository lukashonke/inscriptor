The most important thing is that the AI functions must output text that closely follows user's desired writing style. You will help me refine the description of writing style of my project.

For your reference, here are examples of various well described writing styles:

# ‚úèÔ∏è Default (Neutral) Style
**Narrative Voice and Tone:**: Balanced, clear, and versatile, suitable for a general audience. The voice should be relatable without being overly casual or overly formal. Maintains reader engagement through clarity rather than stylistic flourishes.

**Sentence Structure and Pacing**: Moderate sentence length (15-20 words average) with a steady, natural flow. Mix short punchy sentences for impact with longer ones for explanation. Vary rhythm to avoid monotony.

**Language and Vocabulary**: Plain and accessible, avoiding pretentious vocabulary while not dumbing down concepts. Use everyday words for most descriptions but don't shy away from precise technical terms when needed.

**Dialogue Style**: Realistic and straightforward, supporting character and narrative development. Characters speak naturally without excessive dialect or stylization. Dialogue serves both character revelation and plot advancement.

**Theme and Motives**: Flexible, focusing on clarity and engagement without leaning too heavily on any specific style. Universal themes that resonate across demographics.

=====

Example snippets:

The meeting had been going on for three hours, and Sarah was starting to feel the weight of it. She glanced at her watch, then back at the presenter, trying to maintain focus.

\"So what you're saying,\" she interrupted, \"is that we need to completely restructure our approach?\"

The room fell silent. Everyone turned to look at her, some with surprise, others with relief that someone had finally said it.

Mark cleared his throat. \"Essentially, yes. The data doesn't lie.\"

Sarah nodded slowly, processing the implications. This would change everything they'd been working toward for the past six months. But sometimes, she thought, that's exactly what needed to happen.

Outside, the city hummed with its usual energy, oblivious to the small revolution taking place in conference room 4B.

=====


# üëª Horror/Suspense Style:
**Narrative Voice and Tone:**: Atmospheric and unsettling, building dread through what's not shown as much as what is. The voice should create unease through subtle wrongness and growing tension. Reliability of narrator may be questioned as story progresses.

**Sentence Structure and Pacing**: Varies dramatically‚Äîlong, creeping sentences for building tension, short fragments for shocks. Paragraphs shrink during intense scenes. Uses white space and section breaks to control reader breathing. Rhythm mimics heartbeat‚Äîslow, then racing.

**Language and Vocabulary**: Sensory details emphasizing sound, smell, and touch over sight. Ordinary words become sinister through context. Body horror through visceral but not gratuitous description. Ambiguity in descriptions lets reader's imagination fill horrifying gaps.

**Dialogue Style**: Conversations that seem normal but carry underlying wrongness. Characters speak past each other, hinting at unseen knowledge. Silence and pauses carry weight. Children's voices particularly effective for disturbing effect.

**Theme and Motives**: Fear of the unknown, loss of control, corruption of the familiar. The horror of ordinary life twisted slightly wrong. Isolation‚Äîphysical, emotional, or existential. The thin boundary between sanity and madness. Sometimes evil wins.

=====

Example snippets:

The children in apartment 3B stopped laughing on Tuesday.

Meredith noticed because she'd been tracking the sounds for weeks now, documenting them in her journal with the obsessive precision of the recently unemployed. 9:17 AM: footsteps, running. 9:45 AM: giggles. 10:23 AM: a ball bouncing.

But on Tuesday: nothing.

She pressed her ear to the wall, holding her breath. The silence had weight to it, thick and unnatural. Even the building's usual groans seemed muffled, as if the walls themselves were listening.

\"You're being ridiculous,\" she told herself, but her voice cracked on the last syllable.

She'd never actually seen the children. Only heard them through the thin walls of the converted brownstone. The landlord‚ÄîMr. Garrett with his watery eyes and trembling hands‚Äîinsisted 3B was vacant. Had been for years.

\"Mice,\" he'd said. \"Old buildings make all sorts of sounds.\"

But mice didn't laugh. Mice didn't sing nursery rhymes at 3 AM.

On Wednesday, the smell started. Sweet and cloying, like overripe fruit mixed with something chemical. It seeped through the ventilation system, coating the back of her throat.

She knocked on 3B's door. Once. Twice. The sound seemed to disappear into the wood, swallowed whole.

\"Hello?\" Her voice was barely a whisper. \"Is everything okay in there?\"

The doorknob turned.

She hadn't touched it.

The door swung inward, revealing darkness that looked solid, tangible. The smell rolled out in waves, and underneath it, she could hear something. Not laughter. Not anymore.

Breathing. Wet and labored, as if through liquid.

\"Come in,\" a child's voice said from the darkness. But the words were wrong, shaped by a throat that wasn't meant for human speech. \"We've been waiting for you.\"

Meredith stood frozen on the threshold. Behind her, she heard her own apartment door click shut.

She was in the hallway now. No way back.

The breathing grew louder, and she realized with cold certainty that it wasn't coming from apartment 3B.

It was coming from right behind her.

\"We've been so lonely,\" the voice whispered, and small, wet fingers wrapped around her wrist. \"But now you can play with us forever.\"

The last thing Meredith saw before the darkness took her was her journal, lying open on the hallway floor. The final entry, written in a child's crayon scrawl:

She heard us. She heard us. She heard us.

The children in apartment 3B started laughing again on Thursday.
=====

# ‚ö° Commercial Thriller Style
**Narrative Voice and Tone:**: Urgent and propulsive, creating immediate tension and maintaining relentless forward momentum. The voice should be confident and direct, pulling readers through the story with cinematic intensity. Every paragraph earns its place by advancing plot or ratcheting tension.

**Sentence Structure and Pacing**: Short, punchy sentences dominate (8-15 words average), with occasional longer sentences for variety. Paragraphs are brief‚Äîoften just one or two sentences. Chapters end on cliffhangers. White space is used strategically to increase reading speed.

**Language and Vocabulary**: Clear, concrete language focusing on action and sensory details. Strong, active verbs drive every sentence. Technical terms are used sparingly and explained through context. Avoids adverbs in favor of more precise verbs.

**Dialogue Style**: Crisp, purposeful exchanges that reveal information and advance plot simultaneously. Characters speak in distinct voices with minimal dialogue tags. Interruptions, overlapping conversations, and unfinished sentences create realistic urgency.


**Theme and Motives**: Good versus evil with clear stakes. Themes of justice, survival, and moral compromise under pressure. Heroes are flawed but ultimately sympathetic. Villains are competent and genuinely threatening.

=====

Example snippets:

The phone rang at 3:47 AM.

Jack Reeves knew before answering‚Äînobody called with good news at this hour. He grabbed the phone on the second ring, already swinging his legs out of bed.

\"Reeves.\"

\"We have a situation.\" Director Chen's voice was steel. \"How fast can you get to Langley?\"

\"Twenty minutes.\"

\"Make it fifteen.\"

The line went dead. Jack was already moving, muscle memory guiding him through the darkness. Weapon from the nightstand. Go bag from the closet. Three years of retirement evaporating like morning mist.

His phone buzzed again. A text this time. One word that changed everything:

PROMETHEUS

Jack's blood turned to ice. They'd sworn it would never happen. Sworn the failsafes would hold.

He made it to Langley in twelve minutes, running three red lights. The guard at the gate took one look at his face and waved him through.

Chen was waiting in the situation room, satellite feeds covering every wall. \"Forty minutes ago, someone breached the Prometheus facility.\"

\"That's impossible‚Äî\"

\"They have the codes, Jack. All of them.\"

=====


# Young Adult Contemporary Style
**Narrative Voice and Tone**: Authentic, immediate, and emotionally honest, capturing the intensity of teenage experience without condescension. The voice should feel genuinely young while tackling serious themes. Often uses first-person present tense for immediacy and connection.

**Sentence Structure and Pacing**: Conversational rhythm with varied sentence lengths (10-25 words average). Fragments used for emphasis and emotional punch. Quick pacing with short chapters that end on emotional beats rather than cliffhangers.

**Language and Vocabulary**: Contemporary vernacular that feels current without being tryhard. Natural use of technology and social media references. Vocabulary is accessible but not dumbed down‚Äîteens are smart readers who appreciate being treated as such.

**Dialogue Style**: Rapid-fire exchanges with authentic teen speech patterns‚Äîinterruptions, slang, pop culture references. Texting and social media integrated naturally into narrative. Characters have distinct voices reflecting their personalities and backgrounds.

**Theme and Motives**: Identity, belonging, first love, family dynamics, friendship, and finding your place in the world. Addresses real issues teens face‚Äîmental health, social pressure, family problems‚Äîwith hope and authenticity. Coming-of-age themes treated with respect and nuance.

=====

Example snippets:

I'm seventeen years old and I've already ruined my life.

That's what I'm thinking as I sit in Principal Morrison's office, staring at the motivational posters that are trying way too hard. \"Reach for the Stars!\" one screams in Comic Sans. As if Comic Sans has ever motivated anyone to do anything except change fonts.

My phone buzzes. Mom, probably. Or Dad. Or literally anyone who's seen the video by now.

Which is everyone.

\"Mia.\" Principal Morrison looks at me over her glasses‚Äîthe kind of look that's supposed to make you feel small. It's working. \"Do you understand the severity of this situation?\"

I want to laugh. Or cry. Or possibly both. Instead, I say, \"Yes.\"

But that's a lie. I don't understand anything anymore. Not how a thirty-second video could destroy everything I've worked for. Not how Jayden could post it after promising‚Äî

My phone buzzes again.

UNKNOWN NUMBER: everyone makes mistakes. this doesn't define you.

I stare at the text. Who sends anonymous supportive messages?

\"I'm going to need your phone,\" Principal Morrison says, holding out her hand.

I hand it over, but I'm still thinking about that text. Maybe I haven't ruined everything. Maybe this is just the beginning of a different story.

A story where I figure out who I really am when everything I thought mattered falls apart.

=====

# üíï Romantic Comedy Style
**Narrative Voice and Tone**: Witty, warm, and self-aware with a light touch even when dealing with deeper emotions. The voice should sparkle with humor while maintaining genuine emotional stakes. Often uses direct address or humorous observations about life and love.

**Sentence Structure and Pacing**: Snappy pacing with varied sentence lengths (12-25 words average). Comedic timing through paragraph breaks and punchy one-liners. Builds to comedic and romantic peaks with careful rhythm. Uses callbacks and running gags for continuity.

**Language and Vocabulary**: Contemporary and conversational with clever wordplay and pop culture references. Metaphors drawn from everyday life, often with humorous exaggeration. Avoids crude humor in favor of clever observations and situational comedy.

**Dialogue Style**: Quick, bantering exchanges with sexual tension disguised as verbal sparring. Characters have distinct comedic voices. Misunderstandings and miscommunications drive plot. Subtext where characters say one thing but mean another, obvious to readers.

**Theme and Motives**: Love conquers pride, fear, and misunderstandings. Personal growth through romantic challenge. Family and friendship as both obstacles and support. The idea that the right person helps you become your best self. Happy endings are mandatory.

=====

Example snippets:

I should have known the day would go sideways when I put my dress on backwards and didn't notice until lunch.

In my defense, it was a very stressful morning. I'd just landed the Preston Industries account‚Äîthe career-making, champagne-popping, maybe-I-can-finally-afford-good-cheese account‚Äîand I was running on three hours of sleep and enough caffeine to power a small city.

Which might explain why I walked straight into him.

Not bumped. Not brushed past. Full-on collision, complete with coffee explosion and papers flying like extremely boring confetti.

\"I'm so sorry!\" I scrambled to collect the scattered documents, which appeared to be contracts worth more than my annual salary. \"I'm not usually a walking disaster. Well, that's not true. I am, but usually with better aim.\"

\"It's fine.\" His voice was annoyingly calm for someone wearing my latte. \"Though I usually prefer my coffee in a cup.\"

I looked up, ready with another apology, and forgot how words worked.

Oh no. Oh no no no.

It was him. Connor Preston. As in Preston Industries Preston. As in my new client's son Preston. As in the man I'd spent all night researching, whose photo I may or may not have stared at for a completely professional amount of time.

He was even better looking in person, which seemed deeply unfair. The universe should have given the rest of us a fighting chance.

\"You're wearing your dress backwards,\" he observed, the corner of his mouth twitching.

I looked down. He was right. The deep V that was supposed to be in the back was... not in the back.

\"It's a... fashion statement,\" I said weakly.

\"Interesting.\" He handed me the last of the papers, his fingers brushing mine. \"And do you have a name, or should I just call you Backwards Dress Girl?\"

\"Olivia Chen. Your new marketing director. We have a meeting in...\" I checked my phone. \"Seven minutes.\"

His eyebrows shot up. \"You're Olivia Chen? The one who pitched the 'Romance Your Customer' campaign?\"

\"That's me. Though I usually romance them with less physical assault.\"

He laughed‚Äîa real laugh, not the polite corporate chuckle I expected. \"Well, this should be interesting. Should I change, or is wearing coffee also a fashion statement?\"

\"Depends. Are you trying to impress anyone?\"

\"I was.\" He gave me a look that made my knees forget their job. \"But I think I already failed spectacularly.\"

As he walked away, I realized three things:
1. My dress was still on backwards
2. I was in so much trouble
3. I couldn't wait for that meeting

Universe: 1, Olivia: 0.

But the game wasn't over yet.

=====


‚öîÔ∏è Epic Fantasy Style
**Narrative Voice and Tone**: Grand and immersive, with a sense of mythic weight and historical significance. The voice should balance accessibility with the formal cadences of epic storytelling. Multiple POVs weave together to create a tapestry of perspectives across a vast world.

**Sentence Structure and Pacing**: Varied lengths (15-30 words average) with longer sentences for world-building and description. Pacing builds slowly, allowing readers to absorb complex worldbuilding. Action scenes shift to shorter, punchier sentences. Uses parallel structure for prophecies and formal speech.

**Language and Vocabulary**: Elevated but not archaic language. Creates linguistic authenticity through consistent naming conventions, invented terms for magic/culture, and formal modes of address. Avoids modern idioms that would break immersion. Rich sensory descriptions of settings and magic.

**Dialogue Style**: Formal registers for nobility/ancient beings, varied dialects for different regions/peoples. Characters speak in ways that reflect their culture and station. Prophecies and oaths carry weight. Uses \"said\" bookisms sparingly but effectively for fantasy creatures.

**Theme and Motives**: Power and its corruption, destiny versus free will, the price of heroism, the nature of good and evil. Coming-of-age within epic stakes. Environmental and cultural themes woven through worldbuilding. Hope persisting in darkness.

=====

Example snippets:

The first sign of the Sundering was not the earthquakes, as the histories would later claim, but the silence of the dragons.

Kael Brightward stood on the watchtower's highest parapet, watching the empty skies above the Thornwood Mountains. For three days now, no dragon-song had echoed across the valley. For three days, the ancient pact had felt brittle as old parchment.

\"My lord?\" Captain Thessa's voice carried the weight of unspoken questions. \"The council awaits.\"

Kael didn't turn. Somewhere beyond those peaks, in the Shadowlands where even dragons feared to fly, something was stirring. He could feel it in his bones‚Äîthe same deep ache his grandmother had described before the War of Ashes.

\"Tell them I'll be there shortly.\" His hand moved unconsciously to the runestone at his throat. It was cold. It had never been cold before.

\"There's more, my lord. A rider arrived from the Eternal Library. The Keepers are sealing the vaults.\"

Now Kael did turn. The Keepers hadn't sealed the vaults in eight hundred years. Not since‚Äî

\"The Void Prophecy,\" he breathed.

Thessa nodded grimly. \"The stars are moving, my lord. The constellation of the Broken Crown rose three hours before its time.\"

In the distance, a sound like thunder rolled across the mountains. But the sky was clear, painfully clear, and Kael knew with terrible certainty that this was not thunder.

The dragons weren't silent because they had abandoned their posts.

They were silent because they were hiding.

\"Send ravens to all the border keeps,\" Kael commanded, already moving toward the stairs. \"Tell them to light the warning fires. And Thessa‚Äî\" He paused, meeting her eyes. \"Wake the Stone Guard. All of them.\"

\"All seven legions, my lord?\"

\"We're going to need every sword in the kingdom before this ends.\" He looked back at the mountains one last time. \"The Age of Peace is over.\"

As if in answer, the runestone at his throat began to burn.

=====


# üí¨ Simple/Conversational Style
**Narrative Voice and Tone**: Friendly, informal, and approachable, as if talking to a friend over coffee. Uses \"you\" to address reader directly. Feels like a natural conversation rather than formal writing. Warm and encouraging without being condescending.

**Sentence Structure and Pacing**: Short to medium sentences (10-15 words average) with a steady, easy flow. Lots of sentence variety to maintain conversational rhythm. Frequent paragraph breaks to avoid text walls. Uses contractions naturally (it's, you're, don't).

**Language and Vocabulary**: Everyday language that a middle schooler could understand. Avoids jargon and complex terminology unless absolutely necessary, and explains it simply when used. Prefers common words over fancy alternatives. Uses analogies and examples from daily life.

**Dialogue Style**: Casual and relatable, reflecting how people actually talk. Includes interruptions, incomplete thoughts, and natural speech patterns. Characters use contractions and colloquialisms. Avoids overly formal or stilted dialogue.

**Theme and Motives**: Communicates ideas or stories in an accessible way for broad audiences. Makes complex topics feel simple and approachable. Often includes personal anecdotes and relatable examples. Aims to connect with readers on a human level.

=====

Example snippets:

Look, I get it. Starting a new habit is tough. You've probably tried before and given up after a few days. We all have.

But here's the thing - you don't need to be perfect. You just need to show up.

Let me tell you about my friend Jake. He wanted to start running, but every time he'd set these crazy goals. \"I'm gonna run 5 miles every morning!\" he'd say. By day three, he'd be back on the couch, feeling like a failure.

Then he tried something different. He decided to just put on his running shoes every morning. That's it. Some days he'd run. Some days he'd walk. Some days he'd just stand on his porch in his running shoes, then go back inside.

Sounds silly, right? But after two weeks, something clicked. Putting on those shoes became automatic. And once he had them on, well, might as well take a few steps...

Six months later? Jake's running three times a week and actually enjoying it. All because he made it stupid simple to start.

=====

# Journalistic Style
**Narrative Voice and Tone**: Direct, factual, and impartial. Objective observer reporting facts without personal opinion. Maintains professional distance from subjects. Authority comes from accuracy and sourcing, not personal perspective.

**Sentence Structure and Pacing**: Short, declarative sentences prioritizing clarity. Lead sentences contain who, what, when, where, why. Inverted pyramid structure - most important information first. One idea per sentence for easy scanning.

**Language and Vocabulary**: Plain, accessible language free from jargon. Precise word choice avoiding ambiguity. Active voice preferred (\"Police arrested\" not \"were arrested by police\"). Attribution phrases (alleged, reportedly, according to).

**Dialogue Style**: Direct quotes from sources with clear attribution. Alternates between paraphrase and quotes. Uses partial quotes for impact. Always identifies speakers and their relevance/authority.

**Theme and Motives**: Reports facts with strict objectivity. Provides context without editorializing. Multiple sources for balance. Answers reader questions efficiently. Transparency about what's known and unknown.

=====

Example snippets:

BREAKING: City Council approves controversial $2.3 billion development project in 5-4 vote following heated six-hour debate.

The Riverside City Council narrowly approved a mixed-use development project Tuesday night that will transform 50 acres of industrial waterfront into luxury apartments and retail space, despite fierce opposition from environmental groups and longtime residents.

The vote came after more than 200 speakers addressed the council during a marathon session that stretched past midnight.

\"This is a dark day for our community,\" said Maria Rodriguez, president of the Riverside Tenants Union, moments after the vote. \"They chose developer profits over people.\"

Developer Apex Holdings has pledged 500 affordable units among the project's 3,000 total residences. Company CEO James Morrison called the approval \"a victory for smart growth.\"

\"We're creating homes, jobs, and public spaces where abandoned warehouses sit today,\" Morrison told reporters.

The project faces additional hurdles. Environmental groups have threatened legal action, citing concerns about increased flooding risk and displacement of low-income residents. A state environmental review is pending.

Councilmember Janet Chen, who cast the deciding vote, defended her decision. \"It wasn't easy, but the housing crisis demands bold action,\" Chen said.

Construction could begin as early as next spring, according to city planning officials.

=====

# üòÇ Humorous/Lighthearted Style
**Narrative Voice and Tone**: Witty, playful, and self-aware. Often breaks the fourth wall or acknowledges absurdity. Confident enough to be silly. Finds humor in everyday situations. Never mean-spirited, always inclusive.

**Sentence Structure and Pacing**: Quick and punchy for comedic timing. Varies rhythm for setup and punchline. Short sentences for zingers, longer ones for elaborate setups. Strategic use of fragments. Paragraph breaks for comic beats.

**Language and Vocabulary**: Unexpected word choices and creative combinations. Puns, wordplay, and double meanings. Exaggeration and understatement for effect. Pop culture references and anachronisms. Technical terms used incorrectly for humor.

**Dialogue Style**: Quirky, exaggerated, or deliberately awkward. Characters have distinct comic voices. Misunderstandings and non-sequiturs. Deadpan delivery contrasting with ridiculous situations. Comic timing through interruptions.

**Theme and Motives**: Entertainment first, but often sneaks in truth through humor. Makes difficult topics approachable. Celebrates human absurdity. Uses laughter to create connection. Never punches down.

=====

Example snippets:

Let me tell you about the time I decided to become a morning person. Spoiler alert: it went about as well as teaching a cat to fetch.

Day 1: Set seventeen alarms. Woke up at noon wondering why my phone was having a seizure.

Day 2: Put alarm clock across room. Discovered I'm an Olympic-level sleepwalker who can turn off alarms and return to bed without waking up. Fascinating. Terrifying. But mostly fascinating.

Day 3: Downloaded app that makes you solve math problems to turn off alarm. Learned I'd rather fail calculus than consciousness.

\"You just need to find your motivation,\" my insufferably chipper friend Madison told me over coffee. She'd been up since 5 AM. For fun. I'm pretty sure she's actually three caffeinated squirrels in a trench coat.

\"My motivation is sleep,\" I explained. \"I'm very motivated to do it.\"

\"But think of all you could accomplish!\"

I thought about it. I could accomplish being asleep for two more hours. That seemed pretty significant.

By Day 7, I'd made progress. I was now waking up at 9:59 AM instead of 10. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was my circadian rhythm, apparently. Though to be fair, the Romans probably weren't trying to build Rome at 6 AM either. They were smarter than that.
